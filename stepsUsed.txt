Note: application.properties file is also called "conf" in this text file.
step1: created basic app from spring boot initializr
2: in application.properties file, added serverport, datasource and jpa configurations.
3: created WEB-INF folder then inside it /jsp/index.jsp
3: created WelcomeController, 
	(i.)showWelcomePage(): in normal mvc project we return ModelAndView object, by telling suffix, prefix in viewresolver
							but in spring boot we can configure suffix and prefix in application.properties, that we did
							by adding mvc configurations. Now try to access localhost:6060/ will show index.jsp.
							Its important to note that jsp file (in tomcat server) can be used by using jasper dependency.
							I added it manually in pom.xml.
	(ii.)Then I tried to change jsp to html in mvc dependency inside application.properties. But it didn't work as the
		 spring boot was throwing type (which is html here) not found 404 error. It turns out (though not sure and still
		 I do not believe it) that spring boot asks us to keep all our static files (like html, css, js) in resources
		 folder and it looks for html files in templates folder. So I created index.html inside templates folder. 
		 And for static file, we need to return ModelAndView object only (with file name), so I created below function.
	(iii.)showWelcomeHtmlPage(): This function is returning ModelAndView but now the issues are two folds. If (in 
		  conf) we write the suffix prefix as our inde.jsp's path then from ModelAndView also, it takes name as index 
		  and shows that jsp file. If I remove mvc configuration from conf then it gives type not found error. What 
		  we want though is: 1. If I return ModelAndView page then it should by default consider static area and take 
		  my html file. 2. If Simple string is returned (like we did in previous eg) then it should give use the 
		  view resolver suffix, prefix configurations and go to file accordingly. 
		  For this thing, we have to add another dependency named "thymeleaf". After adding it everything worked fine.
